# docker-php-5.3-composer
Build of composer on PHP 5.3 in the style of the official repositories

We have some legacy projects that need to be build in an old PHP 5.3 environment.

This docker image is intended to allow composer to be run locally on that PHP version.


Please report bugs for this container to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tomsowerby/docker-php-5.3-composer/issues) page.
